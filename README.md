# 🚀 Quick Vault

Quick Vault is a lightweight web application that allows users to securely store and retrieve temporary text, codes, or sensitive information using a simple 4-digit code — without requiring login.

All stored data automatically expires after 31 days to maintain privacy and avoid misuse.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I often had to log in to WhatsApp or other platforms just to save small codes or notes.  
Clipboard tools lose data quickly and messaging apps are not built for temporary secure storage.

So I built Quick Vault as a simple, fast, and secure solution.
